### Naming
<p>The word "<b>Gitigar</b>" is a Persian (Farsi) phrase which is made up of two words, first "Giti" which means material world (kinda old fashioned in modern Persian!) and second is the suffix "<b>-gar</b>" which means builder or maker (something like the suffix "-er" in English). So it simply means "Worldbuilder".<p>
